What were the inputs you gave the simulation? (Population size, percent vaccinated, virus name, mortality rate, reproductive rate)
* Exact terminal command passed in: python3 simulation.py Ebola 0.25 0.7 100000 0.90 10
** This gave the virus the name of "Ebola" with a mortality rate of 70% and a reproductive rate of 25%
** The initial population was 100000 with a 90% vaccination rate and 10 people initially infected
What percentage of the population became infected at some point before the virus burned out?
* The total number of infected people(including both people that died from infection and were vaccinated) was 10968
* Making it so the virus at some point infected almost 11% of the initial population
What percentage of the population died from the virus?
* Total amount of people that died was 1355, nearly 1.4% of the initial population
Out of all interactions sick individuals had during the entire simulation, how many total interactions did we see where a vaccination saved a person from potentially becoming infected?
* 10968 - 1355 = 9613 total people saved from the vaccination
